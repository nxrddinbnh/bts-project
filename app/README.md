## System Description

The **Pansol CAN** system (by *MAT Ã‰lectronique*) includes:

- Motorized solar panels with azimuth and elevation control.
- Electronic modules communicating over a CAN bus.
- Management of solar energy production and emergency lighting via a 64-LED white light block.


## Problem Statement

Legacy software tools (`Console de maintenance` and `CAN Sniffer`) are outdated, Windows XPâ€“dependent, and lack:

- Real-time data visualization.
- Persistent logging and archival.
- Integration capabilities with modern web systems.


## Project Objectives

- Replace legacy tools with a single, intuitive PyQt6 application.
- Enable robust serial and CAN communication.
- Support CAN frame visualization, injection, and logging.
- Store system data in a modern SQL database.
- Provide optional web access to system data and logs.

## Key Features

- USB serial communication.
- Real-time monitoring of solar energy production.
- Diagnostics for lighting, motors, and system corrections.
- Manual and automatic motor positioning controls.
- CAN frame search and filtering.
- Modular PyQt6 UI with custom widgets.
- Optional REST API for web dashboard integration.
